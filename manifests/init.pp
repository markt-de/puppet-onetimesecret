#
# @param options

#   resources.
#
# @param pid_dir

#
# @param pid_file
#   The PID file for the main One-Time Secret web service (absolute path required).
#
# @param redis_password
#   A password for connections to the Redis server. It will also be used when
#   setting up a new Redis instance for One-Time Secret.

#   Specifies the service provider. Must be compatible with the operating system.
#
# @param symlink_name
#   Controls the name of a version-independent symlink. It will always point
#   to the release specified by `$version`.
#
# @param uid
#   The UID of the user.
#
# @param use_default_options
#   Set to `false` to completely disable loading of the default configuration.
#   In this case you are required to provide a fully working configuration.
